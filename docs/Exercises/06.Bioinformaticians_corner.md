# 06.Bioinformaticians corner *

Right, at this point I always feel that I am failing to address the bioinformatician community. 
The examples until this point are absolutely generic, but I am convinced that the best way to explain or illustrate something is explaining it in terms of your own field of interest. 

Here I found an excellent tutorial, essentially doing the same things or slightly different but on "transcriptome" /_whatever that means_/ data file. If you are an bioinformatician, I strongly recommend following the tutorial, which might be more beneficial for you rather than jumping in less common situations that I am trying to present here.


[AWK GTF! How to Analyze a Transcriptome Like a Pro - Part 1](http://reasoniamhere.com/2013/09/16/awk-gtf-how-to-analyze-a-transcriptome-like-a-pro-part-1/)


It is really nice exercise for the rest as well /the ones that do not know what is transcriptome/. 
If you want to experience, how the bioinformatician feels doing the rest of the exercises on this page /i.e. unaddressed/ - go for it!
