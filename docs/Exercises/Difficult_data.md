# Difficult to extract data ****
Let's assume that we get such an output from a Python program. `#!python [2, 261, 262]` is a list variable that is easy to print but kind off difficult to deal with in this form...
``` python
1 [2, 261, 262] 4.22143226361
2 [96, 447, 448] 3.9916056595
3 [103, 461, 462] 2.94525993079
```
![input](../images/pdata1.png)

Use the data above and try to produce output like this (_color images are for guidance_)
```
O002.H261  O002.H262
O096.H447  O096.H448
O103.H461  O103.H462
```

??? "Possible solutions:"
    ``` awk
    awk -F '[][,]' '{printf("O%03d.H%03d  O%03d.H%03d\n",$2,$3,$2,$4)}' data
    ``` 
    or 
    just by removing the problematic characters...
    ``` awk
    awk '{gsub(","," ",$0); gsub("\\["," ",$0); gsub("\\]"," ",$0); printf("O%03d.H%03d  O%03d.H%03d\n",$2,$3,$2,$4)}' data
    # or with single gsub command
    awk '{gsub(",\\|\\]\\|\\["," ",$0); printf("O%03d.H%03d  O%03d.H%03d\n",$2,$3,$2,$4)}' data
    ``` 
    
    Credits to Jonas SÃ¶derberg for the solution bellow:
    ``` awk
    awk '{red = substr($2,2,length($2)-2); green = substr($3,1,length($3)-1); blue = substr($4,1,length($4)-1); printf( "O%03d.H%03d  O%03d.H%03d\n", red, green, red, blue)} data
    ```
