# Awk or bash

The short answer - keep using bash but have a look at of some awk neat features that might come in handy.

`#!awk cmd= "ls -lrt"` - lets have the command stored for convenience

`#!awk system(cmd)` - will make a system call and execute the command, while sending the output to standard output

`#!awk cmd | getline` - will do the same but you will read the first line from the output.

``` awk
# then let's read all lines and do something
while (cmd | getline) {    
   if ($5 > 200) system("cp "$9" target_folder/")
}
```

Essentially, one gets an extremely easy way to communicate between programs and execute system calls in addition to **convenient arithmetic functions** (for example, _bash does not like fractional numbers_) and you add a lot of flexibility to your decision making script...

Have a look at the [script](./Case_studies/awk_gnuplot.md) that I wrote some 100 years ago that prepares a Gnuplot input to fit [Birchâ€“Murnaghan equation of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch%E2%80%93Murnaghan_equation_of_state), then gets the results from the fit (_without using temporary files_) and prettifies a little bit the final plot. The latest Gnuplot can actually do this internally, but have a look at what one can do with awk.

## Awk and multiple files
Something that awk is really good at is handling of multiple files, as bash does, but combined with all the tools that comes with the language. Look at this Case study [Multiple files - first approach](./Case_studies/multiple_files_I.md) to get an idea why awk could be a better choice in such situation.

## Awk inside bash script
Perhaps, a better idea is to add transparently an awk code into your bash script. Here are simple examples that illustrates two different ways to do it.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

awk '
  BEGIN {print "Hi 3"}
  {print}
' /etc/issue

echo "==================================="
```
Note that with the `<< EOF ... EOF` implementation needs the `$` sign needs to be escaped, otherwise bash will replace it with the content of the shell variable it refers to. This allows you to mix bash and awk in somewhat dangerous way...

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

awk -f - << EOF /etc/os-release
  BEGIN {print "Hi"}
  {print \$0}
EOF

echo "==================================="
```
