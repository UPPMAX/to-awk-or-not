# 4.Brief commands overview    
                               
The language looks a little like C but automatically handles input, field splitting, initialization, and memory management.

* Built-in string and number data types
* No variable type declarations
                               
``` awk                         
data[1]= 330                   
data[3]= "text"     # yes, the elements could be of different type
data[7]= 7.5                   
data["Monday"]= 1               
```
                           
> awk is a great prototyping language

* start with a few lines and keep adding until it does what you want 

> awk gets its input from

* files                        
* redirection and pipes        
* directly from standard input 
 
Common commands and constructions - examples
!!! example "Loop"
    ``` awk
    for (i=1; i<=10; i++) {
      print i
    }
    ```
!!! example "If else statement"
    ``` awk
    if ($1 > 2) {
      print $2 
    } else if ($1 < 2) {
      print $3 
    } else {
      print $3 
    }
    ```
!!! example "While statement"
    ``` awk
    while ($1 < $3) {
      getline; print
    }
    ```

!!! example "Other"
    ``` awk
    print "Text"$1"more text"
    
    printf ("Text %g more text", $1)
    
    next    #  (skips the remaining patterns on the current line of input)
    
    exit    #  (skips the rest of the current line)
    ```

## Predefined variables
<hr />

* **NR** - Number of records processed
* **FNR** - Number of record processed in the current file while `NR` refers to the total record number. For the first file `FNR==NR`, but for the second `FNR` will restart from 1 while `NR` will continue to increment.
* **NF** - Number of fields in current record
* **FILENAME** - name of current input file
* **FS** - Field separator, space or TAB by default
* **OFS** - Output field separator, space by default
* **ARGC/ARGV** - Argument Count, Argument Value array - get arguments from the command line

**$1** - first field value, $2 - second etc. 
 
**$0** - contains the entire line

## Built-in functions
<hr />

### [Arithmetic](http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arithmetic-Ops.html)

> sin(), cos(), atan(), exp(), int(), log(), rand(), sqrt()

### [String manipulation functions](http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arithmetic-Ops.html)

> length(), substitution, find substrings, split strings

### Output

> print, printf(), print and printf to file

### Special

> system() - executes a Unix command e.g., system("date") to execute "date" command. Note double quotes around the Unix command
